This is my personal website. The source files are in the src/ folder. The files that are in this directory are the "final"/production files created through `parcel build index.html`

Feel free to fork it and modify it for your own website (NOTE: delete the files outside of the src/ directory or you'll end up with a mix between this website and your fork)
